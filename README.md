# signtu.re

**Cut the bloat. Save data. Reduce your footprint.**

## 🌍 Why signtu.re?

Every time you send an email, your signature — logos, images, phone numbers, disclaimers — gets sent again and again, sometimes hundreds of times per day.

That’s **unnecessary data**, consuming energy and contributing to **digital waste**.

**signtu.re** replaces bulky email signatures with a simple, elegant link:  
`signtu.re/yourname`

One tiny URL. One huge difference.
